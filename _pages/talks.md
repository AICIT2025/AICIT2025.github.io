**Bio:** 
Pascal O. Vontobel received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering in 1997, the Post-Diploma degree in information techniques in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2003, all from ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
From 1997 to 2002 he was a research and teaching assistant at the Signal and Information Processing Laboratory at ETH Zurich, from 2006 to 2013 he was a research scientist with the Information Theory Research Group at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto, CA, USA, and since 2014 he has been with the Department of Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where, since 2023, he has been a (full) professor, department chairman, and graduate division head. Besides this, he was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2002-2004), a visiting assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2004-2005), a postdoctoral research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2006), and a visiting scholar at Stanford University (2014). His research interests lie in coding and information theory, quantum information processing, data science, communications, and signal processing.

Dr. Vontobel was an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (2009-2012), an Awards Committee Member of the IEEE Information Theory Society (2013-2014), a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Information Theory Society (2014-2015), an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Communications (2014-2017), and currently is a Thomas Cover Dissertation Awards Committee Member of the IEEE Information Theory Society (2023-2025). Moreover, he was a TPC co-chair of the 2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, the 2018 IEICE International Symposium on Information Theory and its Applications, and the 2018 IEEE Information Theory Workshop, along with being the director of the 2021 and 2023 Croucher Summer Course in Information Theory, co-organizing several topical workshops, and being on the technical program committees of many international conferences. Furthermore, he was multiple times a plenary speaker at international information and coding theory conferences, he received an  exemplary reviewer award from the IEEE Communications Society, and was awarded the ETH medal for his Ph.D. dissertation. He is an IEEE Fellow.

**Bio:** 
Dr. Chao-Kai Wen, a professor at the National Sun Yat-sen University's Institute of Communication Engineering, is an IEEE Fellow and a Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate Analytics. He served as the Director of the Institute of Communication Engineering at National Sun Yat-sen University from 2018 to 2021 and as the Vice Dean of the College of Engineering from 2020 to 2023. Prior to joining the university, he worked as an engineer at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and MediaTek (MTK) from 2004 to 2009.

Dr. Wen's primary research focus is on communication signal processing. He currently serves as an editor, associate editor, and guest editor for several IEEE journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, IEEE Communications Letters, and IEEE Communication Magazine. He has received multiple awards, including the 2016 GLOBECOM and 2022 ICC Best Paper Awards, the 2023 Jack Neubauer Memorial Award, and the Best Editor Award for both IEEE Wireless Communications Letters and IEEE Communications Letters.
