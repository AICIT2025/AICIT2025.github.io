**Title:**
On counting arrays with certain properties

**Abstract:**
Consider the set of arrays of size n by n that contain only zeros and ones. How many of these arrays have exactly k ones per column and k ones per row? For k = 1, it is straightforward to find the answer (n factorial). However, for k > 1, solving this problem (even approximately) becomes more interesting and challenging.

In this presentation I will discuss how the above question is motivated by applications in constrained coding, and how it can be approached with tools from graphical models, matroid theory, and real stable polynomials.

(Relevant background about graphical models, matroid theory, and real stable polynomials will be introduced as needed.)

(Based on joint work with Yuwen Huang.)

**Title:** Scalable Evaluation of Generative Models

**Abstract:** Evaluating generative models remains a core challenge in machine learning, especially in the reference-free setting where no ground-truth samples are available. In this talk, I will present recent work on developing scalable and adaptive frameworks for evaluating generative models. We first introduce a method that leverages random Fourier features to efficiently assess the quality of generated samples without relying on reference datasets. Building on this, we explore an online evaluation approach based on multi-armed bandits, allowing for dynamic model selection under limited feedback. I will also discuss ongoing developments and open challenges in building practical and reliable evaluation tools for generative models.

**Title:** Leveraging Change of Parametrization to Navigate Non-convex Optimization Landscape

**Abstract:** The training process of modern machine learning models is essentially the solving of non-convex optimization problems. One major challenge that comes with non-convex objectives is the ubiquitous presence of degenerate critical points such as saddle points and spurious solutions. In order to better solve non-convex problems, we study how these degenerate points can be escaped, under the context of matrix sensing, which is a benchmark non-convex problem that is equivalent to the training of a two layer quadratic neural network. We first discuss how increase of parametrization (a.k.a making the model larger) can convert spurious local minima into saddle points; then we discuss how we could simulate this effect without actually increasing parametrization by projecting the high dimensional tensor escape direction back into matrix space.

**Title:** Managing Heavy-tailed Gradients in Distributed Learning via Improved Quantization Strategies

**Abstract:** In distributed learning, the transmission of gradients with heavy-tailed distributions can significantly strain communication bandwidth, which is a key bottleneck in scaling AI models across multiple computing nodes. As model sizes grow and training data becomes increasingly decentralized, efficient communication of gradients is critical to ensuring the scalability and performance of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Existing quantization methods often fail to adequately balance communication efficiency with convergence accuracy, especially in the presence of heavy-tail gradients. 
To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage quantization strategy that enhances communication efficiency while preserving model accuracy. Our method begins by truncating gradients to mitigate the detrimental effects of long-tail noise, followed by a non-uniform quantization step that compresses gradients based on their statistical distribution. This approach directly tackles the communication bottleneck while minimizing the loss in convergence performance. We rigorously analyze the convergence properties of our quantized distributed SGD and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance. Additionally, we derive optimal closed-form solutions for both the truncation threshold and the non-uniform quantization levels by minimizing the convergence error within given communication constraints. Our theoretical insights, supported by extensive experimental results, show that the proposed approach outperforms existing quantization methods, striking an optimal balance between communication efficiency and convergence accuracy, making it highly suitable for large-scale distributed learning.
