Proving Information Inequalities by Gaussian Elimination

Abstract
------

Proving information inequalities and identities under linear constraints on the information measures is an important problem in information theory. For this purpose, ITIP and other variant algorithms have been developed and implemented, which are all based on solving a linear program (LP). We have recently developed a symbolic computation approach that can solve such LPs very efficiently. In some cases, only the Gaussian elimination is needed without having to solve an LP. In other cases, the original LP is reduced to a much smaller LP.

Brief Biography
-----
Raymond W. Yeung is a Choh-Ming Li Professor of Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He received his B.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell University in Electrical Engineering in 1984, 1985, and 1988, respectively. Before joining CUHK in 1991, he was a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories. He has been serving as Co-Director of the Institute of Network Coding at CUHK since 2010. He is the author of the books A First Course in Information Theory (Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2002) and Information Theory and Network Coding (Springer 2008), which have been adopted by over 100 institutions around the world. In spring 2014, he gave the first MOOC in the world on information theory that reached over 60,000 students to date.

He is a recipient of the 2005 IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award, the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2007, the 2016 IEEE Eric E. Sumner Award, the 2018 ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time Paper Award, the 2021 IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal, and the 2022 Claude E. Shannon Award. In 2015, he was named an Outstanding Overseas Chinese Information Theorist by the China Information Theory Society. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences, Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, and the US National Academy of Inventors.

One-shot Coding using Poisson Processes

Abstract
-----
Finite blocklength analysis is applicable to practical communication scenarios where the message length does not approach infinity. We present an approach to proving finite blocklength coding theorems via the Poisson functional representation, which can be regarded as a mechanism capable of answering queries. Encoding and decoding operations can be performed using queries, and the error probability can be bounded via the Poisson matching lemma. This approach provides tight one-shot and finite blocklength results in various multiuser communication settings, with proofs even shorter than conventional asymptotic techniques in certain settings. This talk is based on a joint work with Venkat Anantharam (UC Berkeley): C. T. Li and V. Anantharam, "A Unified Framework for One-Shot Achievability via the Poisson Matching Lemma," IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 67, no. 5, pp. 2624-2651, 2021.

Information-Directed Sampling: An Information-Theoretic Method for Reinforcement Learning

Abstract
-----
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial and rapidly developing field in modern AI, with applications spanning various real-world scenarios such as LLMs, games, and robotics. A central challenge in RL is to address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, which is not only an elegant theoretical problem but also a key factor affecting its practicality and efficiency. This talk will introduce an information-theory-inspired method, called information-directed sampling (IDS), that effectively addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. In this method, we use mutual information to measure the amount of information that can be learned about the environment, and leverage rate-distortion theory to compress the environment to reduce complexity. IDS then seeks a balance between the amount of learned information (exploration) and the immediate reward (exploitation). Theoretically, IDS is nearly order-optimal in terms of data efficiency in RL and related problems like multi-armed bandits and multi-agent RL, in the sense that its regret approaches information-theoretic lower bounds. This practice not only advances the development of efficient algorithms for RL, but also showcases how information-theoretical insights can drive practical advancements in modern AI.
