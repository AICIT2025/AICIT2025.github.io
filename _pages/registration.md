All attendees must <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/PTiHsBfg4x" target="_blank">register</a> and receive a conference badge in order to participate in conference activities. Please note that online registration is available from **May 15 to June 30, 2025 (AoE)**. After this date, you will need to register at the on-site registration desks at the convention venue starting July 27. AICIT is free for all participants, but we encourage you to become a member of the IEEE Information Theory Society to enjoy privileges such as coffee breaks, lunch, and banquet during the conference. Please click <a href="https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=MEMIT012&searchResults=Y" target="_blank">here</a> to be a member.

**Accommodation**

AICIT has a limited room block in the conference hotel, which is “first come, first served”. We can help to make the reservation according to the registration and you settle the payment upon arrival.
