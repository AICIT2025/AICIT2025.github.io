Please note that online registration is available from **May 15 to June 30, 2025 (AoE)**. After this date, you will need to register at the on-site registration desks at the convention venue starting July 27. AICIT is free for all participants, but we encourage you to become a member of the IEEE Information Theory Society to enjoy privileges such as coffee breaks, lunch, and banquet during the conference.
